## Our team and code

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here. The team has competed in the VEX competition since 2015, becoming the top contender in Japan and representing the nation for nine consecutive years. This year, 99484A has qualified as the top representative of Japan, becoming the tournament and skills champion at our regional finals.

We used to use CPP, but we transitioned to Python last year. This year, two of our teams used Python, with our A team using [vexide](https://vexide.dev/), an experimental V5 framework written in Rust. Come visit our Google Sites-powered website over at [doxarobotics.com](https://www.doxarobotics.com/).

Many of our repos don't have licenses. Please create an issue if you need one, as we're happy to lend our code.

### What does "doxa" mean? 

"Doxa" means "glory" in Greek. We chose this as our team name many years ago because whether we win or lose, we do it all for the glory of God.
