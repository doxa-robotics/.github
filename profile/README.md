# DOXA Robotics: Vex Robotics Team 99484

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here. The team has competed in the VEX competition since 2015, becoming the top contender in Japan and representing the nation for eight consecutive years. Last year, all three of our competing teams -- 99484 A, B, and C -- qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship as the top three teams out of the four qualified from Japan. 

We used to use CPP, but most of our work nowadays is in Python. Most code within this project is private, but at the end of season (Summer 2024), if we remember, we'll make it available to the public.
