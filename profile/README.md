<h1 align="center">VEX Robotics Team 99484</h1>
<h2 align="center">DOXA Robotics</h2>

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here. The team has competed in the VEX competition since 2015, becoming the top contender in Japan and representing the nation for eight consecutive years. Last year, all three of our competing teams -- 99484 A, B, and C -- qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship as the top three teams out of the four qualified from Japan. 

We used to use CPP, but we transitioned to Python this year. Next year, we're planning to use either PROS C++ or Rust (and additionally port okapilib to Rust). Come visit our Google Sites-generated website over at [doxarobotics.com](https://www.doxarobotics.com/).

Many of our repos don't have licenses. Please create an issue if you need one, as we're happy to lend our code.
