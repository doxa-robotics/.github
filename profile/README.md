> [!NOTE]
> 
> You're probably here because you saw our team at VEX Worlds 2024. If so, welcome! Our code for the current season is currently private (but will be open-sourced next week if I remember), but a good idea of our overall project stucture can be found at the [vexmason template repository](https://github.com/zabackary/vexmason-template/). What's vexmason, you ask? Come and find our team in person (we're 99484 with the big Japanese flag hanging above our table) and I can explain, or head over to [the homepage](https://github.com/zabackary/vexmason/) to see what it can do for you.

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here. The team has competed in the VEX competition since 2015, becoming the top contender in Japan and representing the nation for eight consecutive years. Last year, all three of our competing teams -- 99484 A, B, and C -- qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship as the top three teams out of the four qualified from Japan. 

We used to use CPP, but we transitioned to Python this year. Most code within this org is private, but at the end of season (Summer 2024), if we remember, we may make it available to the public.

Come visit our Google Sites-generated website over at [doxarobotics.com](https://www.doxarobotics.com/).

Many of our repos don't have licenses. Please create an issue if you need one, as we're happy to lend our code.
