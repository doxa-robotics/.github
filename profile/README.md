<h1 align="center">DOXA Robotics: VEX Robotics Team 99484</h1>

> Update:
> DOXA Robotics won the knockout tournament at the 2024 VEX ASIJ Competition alongside 4253R from Taipei!

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here. The team has competed in the VEX competition since 2015, becoming the top contender in Japan and representing the nation for eight consecutive years. Last year, all three of our competing teams -- 99484 A, B, and C -- qualified for the VEX Robotics World Championship as the top three teams out of the four qualified from Japan. 

We used to use CPP, but we transitioned to Python this year. Most code within this project is private, but at the end of season (Summer 2024), if we remember, we'll may make it available to the public.
