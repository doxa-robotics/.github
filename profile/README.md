# DOXA Robotics

We are the [Christian Academy in Japan](https://caj.ac.jp) robotics team. Formerly, code was stored over at [99484-programming](https://github.com/99484-Programming), but it was transitioned over here.

We used to use CPP, but most of our work nowadays is in Python. Most code within this project is private, but at the end of season (Summer 2024), if we remember, we'll make it available to the public.
